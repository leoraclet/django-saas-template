## üìñ About

This is a fully featured template for building a **Django**-based **SaaS** application, containerized with
**Docker**. It includes everything from user authentication and background task processing to a **REST API**
with complete documentation.

The frontend is developed using **Vite** and **Svelte**, compiled into static assets and served via Django‚Äôs
template system.

For development, testing, and production, the stack incorporates tools such as **PostgreSQL**,
**Redis**, **Caddy**, **MailHog**, **Sentry**, **Grafana**, and **Prometheus**.

## ‚ú® Features

**Project**

- üìñ **Well-Documented**: Source files include thorough comments and, where applicable, links and explanations to clarify key settings.

**Program**

  - üß± **Django-based backend** Powerful and extensible backend using Django, ideal for SaaS
  applications.

  - üîê **Built-in authentication system** User registration, login, password reset, and more out

    data.

  - üöÄ **Redis integration** In-memory data store for caching, session management, and background
  tasks.

## üöÄ Install & Run

If you'd like to run this Django app on your machine, here are two versions of how to do so by either doing on your [**system**](#-system) or [**using docker**](#-using-docker).

### üè† System

First, make sure the [**`uv`**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) Python package manager is installed on your system.

Once that's done, clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leoraclet/django-saas-template
cd django-saas-template
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You may need to create a virtual environment beforehand:
> ```bash
> uv venv
> ```

Finally, if you have either [**Make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) or
[**Just**](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, you can launch the development server accordingly.

```bash
make migrate  # To migrate the Database (MANDATORY)
make run  # To run the developement server
```

or you can just run simple commands using

```bash
uv run {YOUR_COMMAND}
```

### üê≥ Using Docker

Ensure that [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/) is installed on your system and that the `docker` command is available in your terminal.

To start the Docker setup, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
>
> To rebuild the image from scratch (without using the cache), use the following command:
>```bash
> docker compose build --no-cache
>```

As with local development, you can use the [**`Makefile`**](./Makefile) (or [**`Justfile`**](./Justfile)) to manage Docker-related tasks easily with the following commands:

```bash
make up      # Build (if needed) and start the containers
make down    # Stop and remove containers and associated networks
make build   # Build or rebuild the Docker services
make logs    # View the output logs from running containers
```
